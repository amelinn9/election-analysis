# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, has requested assistance in automating the election audit process using Python. We will need a vote count report to certify this US congressional race. The following are tasks given to complete the election audit of the recent local congressional election.

1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote


## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.47.3

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were "369,711" votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received "23.0%" of the vote and "85,213" number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received "73.8%" of the vote and "272,892" number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received "3.1%" of the vote and "11,606" number of votes.
 - The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate Diana DeGette, who received "73.8%" of the vote and "272,892" number of votes.
  
## Challenge Overview
### Election-Audit Overview
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the election audit:

## Challenge Summary
### Election-Audit Summary
This congressional election audit was completed successfully with Python. The audit would usually be done in Excel, but we were able to automate the process using Python. By automating the process, we were able to generate the election audit report quicker and with less errors. With a few modifications, the code written to complete this audit can be used for any election, including senatorial districts and local elections. Some examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections are:
- the data source file
- the results output file
- the variable names to better describe its contents
